<h1> Node Js Blog </h1>
Built this very basic node blog app, to implement CRUD operations in more efficient way.

<h3>Dependencies</h3>
<strong>1. Slug -</strong> to create a better url and not just a random number in the URL <br><br>
<strong>2. Method-override -</strong> To send PUT and DELETE request through form where only GET and POST methods are available.<br><br>
<strong>3. DOMpurify -</strong> For security purposes, so that user is not able to run any javascript code in the markdown.<br><br>
